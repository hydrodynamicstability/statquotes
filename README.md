## Statistics

- "It is easy to lie with statistics, but it is easier to lie without them." 

  - Frederick Mosteller

- "The aim of basic research is not to produce statistically valid results but to study new phenomena. An evaluation of experimental findings depends on many factors, such as compatibility with other results, predictions to which it leads and so on—such evidence can rarely be evaluated statistically."

  - William Feller (1969)
  
  - Are Life Scientists Overawed by Statistics? (Too Much Faith in Statistics), *Scientific Research*, 4, 24–29.

## Data

- "Without data, everyone is an expert."

  - Ronald D. Snee (1986)
  
  - In pursuit of total quality. *Quality Progress*, 20 (8): 25-31.

- "Data, if it is of poor quality, becomes a pollutant to clear thinking and rational decisions."

  - J. Stuart Hunter

## Experimental design

- "The purpose of statistics in laboratories should be to save labor, time, and expense by efficient experimental designs" rather than null hypothesis testing.

  - William Feller (1967)
  
  - Are Life Scientists Overawed by Statistics? (Too Much Faith in Statistics), *Scientific Research*, 4, 24–29.

- "No amount of statistical maneuvering will get very far without some understanding of how the data were produced."

  - David A. Freedman & Richard A. Berk (2005)
  
  - Statistical assumptions as empirical commitments.  In *Law, Punishment, and Social Control:  Essays in Honor of Sheldon Messenger*, 2d ed., ed. by T. G. Blomberg and S. Cohn.  Aldine de Gruyter, pp. 235-254.
  

- "Block what you can and randomize what you cannot."

  - George E.P. Box, William G. Hunter, and J. Stuart Hunter (1978)
  
  - *Statistics for Experimenters:  An Introduction to Design, Data Analysis, and Model Building*.  Wiley.

## Exploratory and confirmatory

- "Exploratory data analysis is detective work—numerical detective work—or counting detective work—or graphical detective work.”

  - John W. Tukey (1977)
  
  - *Exploratory Data Analysis*.  Addison-Wesley.

- "We’re talking about asking authors, ‘Is this hypothesis testing or exploratory?’ An exploratory study explores new questions rather than tests an existing hypothesis. But scientists have felt that they had to disguise an exploratory study as hypothesis testing and that is totally dishonest. I have no problem with true exploratory science. That is what I did most of my career. But it is important that scientists call it as such and not try to pass it off as something else."

  - Marcia McNutt (2016)
  
  - *Science*, 353, 116–119.

## Correlation

- "...most correlation coefficients should never be calculated." 

  - John W. Tukey (1954)
  
  - Causation, regression, and path analysis. In *Statistics and Mathematics in Biology*, ed. by O. Kempthorne, T.A. Bancroft, J.W. Gowen, and J.L. Lush. Iowa State College Press, pp. 35-66.

## Statistical modeling

- "Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful." 

  - George E.P. Box
  
- "I wish we could learn to look at the data more directly, without the fictional models and priors. On the same wish-list: We should stop pretending to fix bad designs and inadequate measurements by modeling." 

  - David A. Freedman (1995)
  
  - Issues in the foundations of statistics: probability and statistical models. *Foundations of Science*, 1: 19-39.
  
- "Using the data to guide the data analysis is almost as dangerous as not doing so." 
 
  - Frank E. Harrell, Jr. (2001)
  
  - *Regression Modeling Strategies, with Applications to Linear Models, Logistic Regression, and Survival Analysis*. Springer.
  

  
## Categorical data

- "Cross-tabulation before regression." 

  - David A. Freedman (2008)
  
  - Randomization does not justify logistic regression. *Statistical Science*, 23: 237-249.

## Subgroup analyses

- "You should always do them but you should never believe them." 

  - Sir Richard Peto
  
## Statistical inferences

- "At the risk of the obvious, inferences to imaginary populations are also imaginary."

  - David A. Freedman & Richard A. Berk (2005)
  
  - Statistical assumptions as empirical commitments.  In *Law, Punishment, and Social Control:  Essays in Honor of Sheldon Messenger*, 2d ed., ed. by T. G. Blomberg and S. Cohn.  Aldine de Gruyter, pp. 235-254.
  
- Null hypothesis significance testing "often amounts to uncertainty laundering. Any study, no matter how poorly designed and conducted, can lead to statistical significance and thus a declaration of truth or falsity. NHST was supposed to protect researchers from over-interpreting noisy data. Now it has the opposite effect."

  - Blakeley B. McShane and Andrew Gelman (2017)
  
  - Five ways to fix statistics.  *Nature*, 551:  557-559.
  

## Statistical conclusions

- "Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence."

  - Unknown

- "Generally, replication and prediction of new results provide a harsher and more useful validating regime than statistical testing of many models on one data set.  Fewer assumptions are needed, there is less chance of artifact, more kinds of variation can be explored, and alternative explanations can be ruled out."

  - David A. Freedman (1991)
  
  - Statistical models and shoe leather.  *Sociological Methodology*, 21:  291-313.

## Statistical consulting

- "Far better an approximate answer to the right question, which is often vague, than an exact answer to the wrong question, which can always be made precise." 

  - John Tukey (1962)
  
  - The future of data analysis. *Annals of Mathematical Statistics*, 33: 1-67.


## Probability

- "Probability does not exist."

  - Bruno de Finetti (1970)
  
  - *Teoria delle Probabilita*.  Einaudi.
  
- "I doubt that the theory of probability can be reduced to either mathematics or computing, though there are people who claim to have done so."

  - Richard W. Hamming (1991)
  
  - *The Art of Probability for Scientists and Engineers*.  Perseus.


## Mathematics

- "Does anyone believe that the difference between the Lebesgue and Riemann integrals can have physical significance, and that whether say, an airplane would or would not fly could depend on this difference? If such were claimed, I should not care to fly in that plane."

  - Richard W. Hamming (1998)
  
  - Mathematics on a distant planet.  *American Mathematical Monthly*, 105:  640-650.


## Computing

- "The purpose of computing is insight, not numbers."

  - Richard W. Hamming (1962)
  
  - *Numerical Methods for Scientists and Engineers*.  McGraw-Hill.
