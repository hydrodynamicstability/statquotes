## Statistics

- "It is easy to lie with statistics, but it is easier to lie without them." 

  - Frederick Mosteller

## Data

- "Without data, everyone is an expert."

  - Ronald D. Snee (1986)
  
  - In pursuit of total quality. *Quality Progress*, 20 (8): 25-31.

- "Data, if it is of poor quality, becomes a pollutant to clear thinking and rational decisions."

  - J. Stuart Hunter

## Correlation

- "...most correlation coefficients should never be calculated." 

  - John W. Tukey (1954)
  
  - Causation, regression, and path analysis. In *Statistics and Mathematics in Biology*, ed. by O. Kempthorne, T.A. Bancroft, J.W. Gowen, and J.L. Lush. Iowa State College Press, pp. 35-66.

## Statistical modeling

- "Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful." 

  - George E.P. Box
  
- "I wish we could learn to look at the data more directly, without the fictional models and priors. On the same wish-list: We should stop pretending to fix bad designs and inadequate measurements by modeling." 

  - David A. Freedman (1995)
  
  - Issues in the foundations of statistics: probability and statistical models. *Foundations of Science*, 1: 19-39.
  
- "Using the data to guide the data analysis is almost as dangerous as not doing so." 
 
  - Frank E. Harrell, Jr. (2001)
  
  - *Regression Modeling Strategies, with Applications to Linear Models, Logistic Regression, and Survival Analysis*. Springer.
  
## Categorical data

- "Cross-tabulation before regression." 

  - David A. Freedman (2008)
  
  - Randomization does not justify logistic regression. *Statistical Science*, 23: 237-249.

## Subgroup analyses

- "You should always do them but you should never believe them." 

  - Sir Richard Peto
  
## Statistical conclusions

- "Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence."


## Statistical consulting

- "Far better an approximate answer to the right question, which is often vague, than an exact answer to the wrong question, which can always be made precise." 

  - John Tukey (1962)
  
  - The future of data analysis. *Annals of Mathematical Statistics*, 33: 1-67.
