## Statistics

- "It is easy to lie with statistics, but it is easier to lie without them." 

  - Frederick Mosteller

- "Statistics is more a way of thinking or reasoning than a bunch of prescriptions for beating data to elicit answers."

  - C. R. Rao (1997)
  
  - *Statistics and Truth:  Putting Chance to Work*.  World Scientific.
  
- "Statistics is nothing more than a trivial exercise if it does not address real-world problems."

  - Colin Mallows (2006)
  
  - Tukey's paper after 40 years.  *Technometrics*, 48:  319-325.
  
- "In particular, statisticians and other quantitatively trained personnel must avoid being seduced into believing that statistical thinking and tools are the total solution.  Statistics is certainly necessary but it is not sufficient.  Experience has shown that the use of statistical techniques has a limited impact unless its use is supported by a larger system such as total quality.  By institutionalizing total quality we help ensure the proper role and use of quality technology."
 
  - Ronald D. Snee (1986)
  
  - In pursuit of total quality. *Quality Progress*, 20 (8): 25-31.

- "The aim of basic research is not to produce statistically valid results but to study new phenomena. An evaluation of experimental findings depends on many factors, such as compatibility with other results, predictions to which it leads and so on—such evidence can rarely be evaluated statistically."

  - William Feller (1969)
  
  - Are Life Scientists Overawed by Statistics? (Too Much Faith in Statistics), *Scientific Research*, 4: 24–29.

- "Data analysis has its major uses.  They are detective work and guidance counseling.  We should all act accordingly."

  - John W. Tukey (1969)
  
  - Analyzing data:  sanctification or detective work?  *American Psychologist*, 24 (2):  83-91.

## Data

- "[F]or without data, everyone is an expert.  Issues that generate great disagreement and controversy are usually those where little factual data exist."

  - Ronald D. Snee (1986)
  
  - In pursuit of total quality. *Quality Progress*, 20 (8): 25-31.

- "Data, if it is of poor quality, becomes a pollutant to clear thinking and rational decisions."

  - J. Stuart Hunter (1980)
  
  - The national system of scientific measurement.  *Science*, 210:  869-874.

- "Data are not just numbers, they are numbers with a context."

  - George W. Cobb and David S. Moore (1997)
  
  - Mathematics, statistics, and teaching.  *American Mathematical Monthly*, 104:  801-823.
  
- "My experience with data analysis indicates to me that problems with the data themselves are usually more numerous and more serious than problems with methodology."
 
  - John C. Bailar, III (1976)
  
  - Bailar's laws of data analysis.  *Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics*, 20:  113-119.

- "In data analysis, a crucial and often bungled decision is the choice of data to be investigated.  It may pay to ignore a massive majority, if it is distorted by systematic errors."

  - Peter J. Huber (2011)

  - *Data Analysis:  What Can Be Learned from the Past 50 Years*.  Wiley.

## Experimental design

- "The purpose of statistics in laboratories should be to save labor, time, and expense by efficient experimental designs.  But all too frequently statisticians impose all kinds of nonsensical conditions on the poor biologist or psychologist--conditions which, although they produce unequivocal statistical results, actually hinder him in his research."

  - William Feller (1969)
  
  - Are Life Scientists Overawed by Statistics? (Too Much Faith in Statistics), *Scientific Research*, 4: 24–29.

- "No amount of statistical maneuvering will get very far without some understanding of how the data were produced."

  - Richard A. Berk  & David A. Freedman (2003)
  
  - Statistical assumptions as empirical commitments.  In *Punishment, and Social Control:  Essays in Honor of Sheldon Messenger*, 2d ed., ed. by T. G. Blomberg and S. Cohn.  Aldine de Gruyter, pp. 235-254.
  
- "Statistical ideas for producing data to answer specific questions are the most influential contributions of statistics to human knowledge.  Badly designed data production is the most common serious flaw in statistical studies.  Well designed data production allows us to apply standard methods of analysis and reach clear conclusions.  Professional statisticians are paid for their expertise in designing studies; if the study is well designed (and no unanticipated disaster occurred), you don't need a professional to do the analysis.  In other words, the design of data production is *really* important.  If you just say 'Suppose X_1 to X_n are iid observations,' you aren't teaching statistics."

  - George W. Cobb and David S. Moore (1997)
  
  - Mathematics, statistics, and teaching.  *American Mathematical Monthly*, 104:  801-823.

- "To find out what happens to a system when you interere with it you have to interfere with it (not just passively observe it)."

  - G. E. P. Box (1966)
  
  - Use and abuse of regression.  *Technometrics*, 8:  625-629.

- "Block what you can and randomize what you cannot."

  - George E.P. Box, William G. Hunter, and J. Stuart Hunter (1978)
  
  - *Statistics for Experimenters:  An Introduction to Design, Data Analysis, and Model Building*.  Wiley.
  
- "If your experiment needs statistics, you ought to have done a better experiment."

  - Lord Ernest Rutherford, 1908 Nobel Laureate in Chemistry

## Exploratory and confirmatory

- "Exploratory data analysis is detective work—numerical detective work—or counting detective work—or graphical detective work.”

  - John W. Tukey (1977)
  
  - *Exploratory Data Analysis*.  Addison-Wesley.

- "Exploratory data analysis is an attitude, a flexibility, and a reliance on display, NOT a bundle of techniques, and should be so taught.  Confirmatory data analysis, by contrast, is easier to teach and easier to computerize.  We need to teach both; to think about science and engineering more broadly; to be prepared to randomize and avoid multiplicity."

  - John W. Tukey (1980)
  
  - We need both exploratory and confirmatory.  *American Statistician*, 34: 23-25.

- "We’re talking about asking authors, ‘Is this hypothesis testing or exploratory?’ An exploratory study explores new questions rather than tests an existing hypothesis. But scientists have felt that they had to disguise an exploratory study as hypothesis testing and that is totally dishonest. I have no problem with true exploratory science. That is what I did most of my career. But it is important that scientists call it as such and not try to pass it off as something else."

  - Marcia McNutt (2016), now President of the National Academy of Sciences.
  
  - *Science*, 353: 116–119.

- "Exploratory data analysis:  The practice of studying data without preconceived notions as a means of obtaining ill-conceived ones.  The art of seeing a Rembrandt in a Jackson Pollock."

  - Stephen Senn (2007)

  - *Statistical Issues in Drug Development*, second edition.  Wiley.

## Correlation

- "...most correlation coefficients should never be calculated." 

  - John W. Tukey (1954)
  
  - Causation, regression, and path analysis. In *Statistics and Mathematics in Biology*, ed. by O. Kempthorne, T.A. Bancroft, J.W. Gowen, and J.L. Lush. Iowa State College Press, pp. 35-66.
  
- "Why then are correlation coefficients so attractive?  Only bad reasons seem to come to mind.  Worst of all, probably, is the absence of any need to think about units for either variable....Being so disinterested in our variables that we do not care about their units can hardly be desirable."

  - John W. Tukey (1969)
  
  - Analyzing data:  sanctification or detective work?  *American Psychologist*, 24 (2):  83-91.
  

## Statistical modeling

- "Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful." 

  - George E.P. Box
  
- "Very often, a statistician or scientist chooses a method because he or she is familiar with it, rather than because it is appropriate."

  - Peter J. Huber (2011)

  - *Data Analysis:  What Can Be Learned from the Past 50 Years*.  Wiley.

- "Live with the data before you plunge into modeling."

  - Leo Breiman (2001)
  
  - Statistical modeling:  the two cultures.  *Statistical Science*, 16:  199-231.
  
- "I wish we could learn to look at the data more directly, without the fictional models and priors. On the same wish-list: We should stop pretending to fix bad designs and inadequate measurements by modeling." 

  - David A. Freedman (1995)
  
  - Issues in the foundations of statistics: probability and statistical models. *Foundations of Science*, 1: 19-39.
  
- "I am deeply troubled by the current and past use of data models in applications, where quantitative conclusions are drawn and perhaps policy decisions are made."

  - Leo Breiman (2001)
  
  - Statistical modeling:  the two cultures.  *Statistical Science*, 16:  199-231.

- "One reason that statistical analyses are often not accepted or understood is that they are based on unsupported models."

  - Colin L. Mallows (1998)

  - The zeroth problem.  *The American Statistician*, 52:  1-9.
  
- "Using the data to guide the data analysis is almost as dangerous as not doing so." 
 
  - Frank E. Harrell, Jr. (2001)
  
  - *Regression Modeling Strategies, with Applications to Linear Models, Logistic Regression, and Survival Analysis*. Springer.

- "Data will often point with almost equal emphasis at several possible models and it is important that the statistician recognize and accept this."

  - Peter McCullagh and John A. Nelder (1989)
  
  - *Generalized Linear Models*, second edition.  Chapman & Hall.

- "In my opinion, model users should be encouraged to think of models as tools that can aid in informing their judgment, rather than as substitutes for judgment that can best be employed mechanically."

  - Stephen K. McNees (1986)

  - Forecasting accuracy of alternative techniques:  a comparison of U.S. macroecnomic forecasts.  *Journal of Business and Economic Statistics*: 4:  5-15.
  
- "There is no methodology in traditional statistics for assessing the adequacy of a model!  The only thing orthodox frequentist theory can do about models is to reject them, and Bayesian statistics cannot even do that.  Nonrejection does not imply that the model is correct; it does not even tell one whether it adequately represents the data.  On the other hand, a rejected model might be perfectly adequate."

  - Peter J. Huber (2006)
  
  - Discussion, Tukey's paper after 40 years.  *Technometrics*, 48:  332-334.
  
- "Goodness-of-fit tests will reject even perfectly adequate models, once the sample size is large enough, simply because not every nook and cranny can and should be modeled."

  - Peter J. Huber (2011)

  - *Data Analysis:  What Can Be Learned from the Past 50 Years*.  Wiley.
  
## Categorical data

- "Cross-tabulation before regression." 

  - David A. Freedman (2008)
  
  - Randomization does not justify logistic regression. *Statistical Science*, 23: 237-249.

## Subgroup analyses

- "You should always do them but you should never believe them." 

  - Sir Richard Peto
  
## Robust and resistant statistics

- "The problem with it was and is that robustness is not a method, nor a collection of methods (although it is often misrepresented as such), but a concept stretching across methods, and calling for judgment more often than for theorems, proofs or algorithms, at least once the initial hurdles have been taken.  Judgment is required, for example, for the choice of models, tuning constants and breakdown levels.  Bootstrap had a faster initial rise, because it was falsely believed to be an algorithm that could be used in the absence of judgment, but now it is in the same slow boat.  I believe the reason is that judgment calls for thinking, and to think is difficult."

  - Speculations on the path of statistics.  In *The Practice of Data Analysis:  Essays in Honor of John W. Tukey*, ed. by D. R. Brillinger, L. T. Fernholz, and S. Morgenthaler.  Princeton University Press, pp. 26-45.
  
- "Robustness is more than a bag of procedures.  It should be regarded as a state of mind:  a statistician should keep in mind that *all* aspects of a data analytic setup (experimental design, data collection, models, procedures) must be handled in such a way that minor deviations from the assumptions cannot have large effects on the results (a robustness problem), and that major deivations can be discovered (a diagnostic problem).  Only a small part of this can be captured by theorems and proofs, or by canned computer procedures."

  - Peter J. Huber (2011)

  - *Data Analysis:  What Can Be Learned from the Past 50 Years*.  Wiley.
  
## Statistical inferences

- "At the risk of the obvious, inferences to imaginary populations are also imaginary."

  - Richard A. Berk & David A. Freedman (2003)
  
  - Statistical assumptions as empirical commitments.  In *Punishment, and Social Control:  Essays in Honor of Sheldon Messenger*, 2d ed., ed. by T. G. Blomberg and S. Cohn.  Aldine de Gruyter, pp. 235-254.
  
- "On the basis of the same data, you cannot both discover a feature and perform a meaningful statistical test for its presence....it is no longer possible to calculate reliable P-values *after* one has looked at the data -- unless they are based on fresh data, they may be worse than useless, namely misleading."

  - Peter J. Huber (2011)

  - *Data Analysis:  What Can Be Learned from the Past 50 Years*.  Wiley.
  
## Null hypothesis significance testing (NHST)

- "Null hypotheses of no difference are usually known to be false before the data are collected....when they are, their rejection or acceptance simply reflects the size of the sample and the power of the test, and is not a contribution to science."

  - I. Richard Savage (1957)
  
  - Nonparametric statistics.  *J. Amer. Stat. Assoc.*, 52:  331-334.

- "We do not perform an experiment to find out if two varieties of wheat or two drugs are equal.  We know in advance, without spending a dollar on an experiment, that they are not equal.  The difference beween two treatments or between two areas or two groups of people, will show up as 'significantly different' if the experiment be conducted through a sufficient number of trials, even though the difference be so small that it is of no scientific or economic consequence."

  - W. Edwards Deming (1975)
  
  - On probability as a basis for action.  *American Statistician*, 29:  146-152.
  
- "Statisticians classically asked the wrong question--and were willing to answer with a lie, one that was often a downright lie.  They asked 'Are the effects of A and B different?' and they were willing to answer 'no'.  All we know about the world teaches us that the effects of A and B are always different--in some decimal place--for any A and B.  Thus asking 'Are the effects different?' is foolish."

  - John W. Tukey (1991)
  
  - The philosphy of multiple comparisons.  *Statistical Science*, 6:  100-116.

- NHST "often amounts to uncertainty laundering. Any study, no matter how poorly designed and conducted, can lead to statistical significance and thus a declaration of truth or falsity. NHST was supposed to protect researchers from over-interpreting noisy data. Now it has the opposite effect."

  - Blakeley B. McShane and Andrew Gelman (2017)
  
  - Five ways to fix statistics.  *Nature*, 551:  557-559.
  
## Confidence intervals

- "On the whole, however, tests of significance are less frequently useful in experimental work than confidence limits.  In many experiments it seems obvious that the different treatments must have produced some difference, however small, in effect.  Thus the hypothesis that there is *no* difference is unrealistic; the real problem is to obtain estimates of the sizes of the differences."

  - William G. Cochran and Gertrude M. Cox (1957)

  - *Experimental Designs*, second edition.  Wiley.

- "Thus, a frequent mistake is to calculate a confidence interval to contain the population mean when the problem requires a tolerance interval or a prediction interval.  At other times, a tolerance interval is used when a prediction interval is needed.  Such confusion is understandable, because most texts on statistics generally discuss confidence intervals, occasionally make reference to tolerance intervals, but generally consider prediction intervals only in the context of regression analysis."

  - Gerald J. Hahn and William Q. Meeker (1991)

  - *Statistical Intervals:  A Guide for Practitioners*.  Wiley.

- "I am referring to Dr. Neyman's confidence limits. I am not at all sure that the 'confidence' is not a 'confidence trick.'"

  - Sir Arthur Lyon Bowley (1934)

  - Discussion of Jerzy Neyman's paper, On the two different aspects of the representative method:  the method of stratified sampling and the method of purposive selection, *Journal of the Royal Statistical Society*, 97:  558-625.

## Statistical conclusions

- "Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence."

  - Unknown

- "Confirmation comes from repetition.  Any attempt to avoid this statement leads at least to failure and more probably to destruction."

  - John W. Tukey (1969)
  
  - Analyzing data:  sanctification or detective work?  *American Psychologist*, 24 (2):  83-91.

- "Generally, replication and prediction of new results provide a harsher and more useful validating regime than statistical testing of many models on one data set.  Fewer assumptions are needed, there is less chance of artifact, more kinds of variation can be explored, and alternative explanations can be ruled out."

  - David A. Freedman (1991)
  
  - Statistical models and shoe leather.  *Sociological Methodology*, 21:  291-313.

- "Comparison between results from two or more unrelated sources of information may provide a more convincing confirmation of the correctness of an interpretation than any statistical test."

  - Peter J. Huber (2011)

  - *Data Analysis:  What Can Be Learned from the Past 50 Years*.  Wiley.

- "The responsibility lies more heavily on statisticians than on any other professional to make sure that their descriptions of the data not be subject to misinterpretation.  This is what has given our discipline its bad name.  We are all damned liars, because what we do is often presented obscurely and so does not convince.  Of course some of what we do is obscure even to ourselves."

  - Colin L. Mallows (1983)
  
  - Data description.  In *Scientific Inference, Data Analysis, and Robustness*, ed. by G. E. P. Box, T. Leonard, and C.-F. Wu.  Academic Press, 135-151.

- "So statistical methods look like magic, with results pulled out of thin air."

  - Colin L. Mallows (1998)
  
  - The zeroth problem.  *The American Statistician*, 52:  1-9.

- "How does one recognize a good statistical analysis?  Most evaluation of specific data analysis is anecdotal.  An example is briefly described, and the illustrated use of the technique is pronounced successful.  Critics find it all too easy to shift the burden of proof by pronouncing that most statistical analysis is useless or misleading.  The situation is paradoxical because data collection and analysis is a basic tool for evaluation, so that statisticians should be well equipped to construct systems for measuring and analyzing their own performance."

  - Arthur P. Dempster (1983)
  
  - Purposes and limitations of data analysis.  In *Scientific Inference, Data Analysis, and Robustness*, ed. by G. E. P. Box, T. Leonard, and C.-F. Wu.  Academic Press, 117-133.

- "But a word of caution is that statistics users often equate the word "test" with statistical testing....As a statistician, I feel honored that statistics users have this kind of confidence in my profession.  On the other hand, I am also deeply troubled, because in most cases a scientific theory of cause-and-effect has to be tested by the scientists themselves, not by statisticians.  Statisticians have indeed made important contributions to numerous instances of scientific testing; but their role is often blown out of proportion."

  - Chamont Wang (1993)

  - *Sense and Nonsense of Statistical Inference:  Controversy, Misuse, and Subtlety*.  Marcel Dekker.

## Statistical consulting

- "A simple and almost ludicrous definition of the error of the third kind is *the error committed by giving the right answer to the wrong problem*.  In defining it this way we are allowing the statistician the benefit of the doubt by rejecting the possibility that he would give the wrong answer to the wrong question."

  - Allyn W. Kimball (1957)
  
  - Errors of the third kind in statisical consulting.  *J. Amer. Stat. Assoc.*, 52:  133-142.

- "Far better an approximate answer to the right question, which is often vague, than an exact answer to the wrong question, which can always be made precise." 

  - John Tukey (1962)
  
  - The future of data analysis. *Annals of Mathematical Statistics*, 33: 1-67.

- "To call in the statistician after the experiment is done may be no more than asking him to perform a post-mortem examination: he may be able to say what the experiment died of."

  - Ronald A. Fisher (1938)
  
  - Presidential Address.  *Sankhya: The Indian Journal of Statistics*, 4 (1):  14-17.
  
- "The statistician who supposes that his main contribution to the planning of an experiment will involve statistical theory, finds repeatedly that he makes his most valuable contribution simply by persuading the investigator to epxlain why he wishes to do the experiment, by persuading him to justify the experimental treatments, and to explain why it is that the experiment, when completed, will assist him in his research."

  - Gertrude M. Cox (1951)

  - Lecture at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, D.C., 11 January 1951.  Quoted by W. Edwards Deming (1960), *Sample Design in Business Research*.  Wiley.

- "If you don't know whether you are a good statistician or not, here is a simple test:  If your name is Joe Blow and there is a very tough investigation coming up, and the engineers and scientists say, 'We've got to have Joe on the team,' then you will have arrived."

  - George E. P. Box (1998)

  - Statistics as a catalyst to learning by scientific method,  Response to the discussion, *Journal of Quality Technology*, 31:  67-72.

  - Bailar's laws of data analysis.  *Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics*, 20:  113-119.

## Probability

- "It is curious how often the most acute and powerful intellects have gone astray in the calculation of probabilities."

  - William Stanley Jevons (1877)

  - *The Principles of Science:  A Treatise on Logic and Scientific Method*, second edition.  Macmillan.

- "For thirty years, I have found Bayesian statistics to be a rich source of mathematical questions.  However, I no longer see it as the preferred way to do applied statistics, because I find that uncertainty can rarely be quantified as probability."

  - David A. Freedman (1991)

  - A rejoinder to Berk, Blalock, and Mason.  *Sociological Methodology*, 21:  353-358.

- "Probability does not exist."

  - Bruno de Finetti (1970)
  
  - *Teoria delle Probabilita*.  Einaudi.
  
- "I doubt that the theory of probability can be reduced to either mathematics or computing, though there are people who claim to have done so."

  - Richard W. Hamming (1991)
  
  - *The Art of Probability for Scientists and Engineers*.  Perseus.

- "The statistician's report to management should not talk about probabilities.  It will merely give outside margins of error for the results of chief importance.  Administrators are not interested in probabilities; they need to know what figure they can use and within what range they may depend on it."

  - W. Edwards Deming (1960)

  - *Sample Design in Business Research*.  Wiley.

## Mathematics

  - The unreasonable effetiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences.  *Communications in Pure and Applied Mathematics*, 13:  1-14.

- "Does anyone believe that the difference between the Lebesgue and Riemann integrals can have physical significance, and that whether say, an airplane would or would not fly could depend on this difference? If such were claimed, I should not care to fly in that plane."

  - Tukey's paper after 40 years.  *Technometrics*, 48:  319-325.

- "I am not saying that the mathematical aspects of statistics are unimportant, but that the reason that statistics is not a mainstream subject is because it has got lost in a mathematical tributary.  It would be helpful if it was categorized and recognized a uniquely important science rather than as one of the (lesser) branches of applied mathematics."

## Statisticians, Physicists, and Social Science

- "The best thing about being a statistician is that you get to play in everyone's backyard."

  - John W. Tukey

- "Somebody was telling me yesterday that they're making 1400 physics Ph.D.'s a year in this country and there aren't going to be that many who do theoretical physics [after they graduate].  On the other hand, theoretical physicists, it's been well established, can be converted to almost anything....And I don't think we'd get away with training 1400 Ph.D.'s a year in statistics and have most of them leave and go into all sorts of other things."

  - John W. Tukey (1997)
  
  - A conversation with John Tukey.  In *The Practice of Data Analysis:  Essays in Honor of John W. Tukey*, ed. by D. R. Brillinger, L. T. Fernholz, and S. Morgenthaler.  Princeton University Press, pp. 26-45.
  
- "A future professional statistician needs a solid foundation in mathematics and in a science.  One reason for the first requirement is the actual need for mathematical proficiency, but only in part; it is just as important to inure him or her against being intimidated by mathematical fireworks.  The second provides the much needed understanding of the spirit prevailing in the sciences.  A very old-fashioned traditional university education in physics, augmented by probability and statistics courses, may come closest to this ideal."

- "Are physical scientists and engineers too foolish to recognize the value of statistics?  I don't think so.  Rather I think they understand that the basic philosophy that motivates much of the statistics taught in universities is not appropriate for what they do."

  - G. E. P. Box (2006)

  - *Improving Almost Anything:  Ideas and Essays*, revised edition.  Wiley.

- "Statistics has definitely evolved into a field in which people can do their work without actually seeing and doing applications."

## Should I be a statistician?

Richard Olshen:  "Leo, you have a record of wide-ranging interest in and contributions to statistics and statistical computing and probability and pedagogy.  What advice would you give to a young person today who wants to continue in your traditions?  What should he or she study and why?"

Leo Brieman:  "Well Richard, I'm torn in a way because what I might even tell them is, 'Don't go into statistics.'  My feeling is, to some extent, that academic statistics may have lost its way."

(From A Conversation with Leo Breiman, *Statistical Science*, 16:  184-198.)
